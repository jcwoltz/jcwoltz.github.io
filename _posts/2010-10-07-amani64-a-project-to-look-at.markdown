excerpt: 'Have you ever wished you could change the the way a circuit was wired by
  uploading a file? Ok, that is not completely true, but you get the idea.  <a title="Complex

  and <a title="Field-programmable gate array" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>s
  can do that and more. '

<p>Have you ever wished you could change the the way a circuit was wired by uploading a file? Ok, that is not completely true, but you get the idea.  <a title="Complex Programmable Logic Devices" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_programmable_logic_device">CPLD</a>s and <a title="Field-programmable gate array" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>s can do that and more. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-30"></a>You can create a design in a block/schematic editor, assign which pins are which, and upload that design to your CPLD. There are other ways to program these devices, such as VHDL or Verilog HDL. Alright, to the point...</p>
<p>The <a title="Amani64" href="http://majolsurf.net/wordpress/?page_id=368">Amani64</a> is an Arduino shield that contains a Altera MAX 3064A CPLD. Go ahead and check it out. You could <a title="Build your own ultrasonic ranger" href="http://majolsurf.net/wordpress/?page_id=829">build your own ultrasonic ranger</a> with an amani. Stay tuned for more project to come...</p>
