excerpt: "From <a title=\"arduino.cc\" href=\"http://arduino.cc/en/Main/HomePage\">Arduino.cc</a>:\r\n<blockquote>Arduino
  is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on  flexible, easy-to-use
  hardware and software.  It's intended for artists,  designers, hobbyists, and anyone
  interested in creating interactive  objects or environments.</blockquote>\r\nArduino
  is a great learning tool. It has been a platform for me to start with then jump
  into other technologies. I have used the arduino platform to automate certain things
  around the house. Currently that includes air conditioning, some lighting, soon
  to be heating, appliance control, and more. For about $30 anyone can get started
  with arduino. The Arduino IDE  and tools run on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X. This
  is a big advantage for me over PIC microprocessors. They provide <a title=\"Arduino
  Tutorials\" href=\"http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage\">tutorials</a> and an<a
  title=\"Arduino Interfacing with Hardware\" href=\"http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/InterfacingWithHardware\">
  interfacing with hardware</a> section. Also there is a great, helpful, and friendly
  community over at the <a title=\"Arduino Forum\" href=\"http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl\">Arduino
  Forum</a>."

<p>If/when the time comes to move your project off the breadboard and onto something more permanent, you don't have to use a $30 device for each project. You can use a variety of Arduino compatible boards or make your own board with an AVR microprocessor. Here is a short list of Arduino compatible boards:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Adafruit Boarduino" href="http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=19&amp;products_id=72">Adafruit: DC Boarduino</a></li>
<li><a title="BBB Kit" href="http://www.moderndevice.com/products/bbb-kit">Modern Device: Bare Bones Board (BBB)</a></li>
<li><a title="RBBB" href="http://www.moderndevice.com/products/rbbb-kit">Modern Device: Really Bare Bones Board (RBBB)</a></li>
<li>Modern Device: <a title="JeeNode v4" href="http://www.moderndevice.com/products/jeenode-kit">JeeNode v4</a></li>
<li>Modern Device: <a title="Sanguino" href="http://www.moderndevice.com/products/sanguino">Sanguino</a></li>
<li>SparkFun: Arduino Pro 328(<a title="Arduino Pro 5v" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9219">5V 16MHz</a> and <a title="Arduino Pro 3.3" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9221">3.3V 8MHz</a>)</li>
<li>SparkFun: Arduino Pro Mini 328(<a title="Arduino Pro Mini 5v" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9218">5V 16MHz</a> and <a title="Arduino Pro Mini 3.3" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9220">3.3V 8MHz</a>)</li>
<li>SparkFun: <a title="Arduino FIO" href="http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=9712">Arduino FIO</a></li>
<li>SeeedStudio: <a title="Seeeduino Stalker" href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/seeeduino-stalker-atmega-328-p-600.html?cPath=79_80">Seeeduino Stalker</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a complete list, but just a highlight of a select few compatible arduino boards. Some of these boards include XBee sockets. Other are stripped down carrier boards. As mentioned earlier, you can make your own board and design using an AVR atmega328 and a handful of components for less than $10. It is completely up to you.</p>
<p>If/when the time come that you need to use a different ATMega or ATTiny series microprocessor, using arduino has given you a head start on the software. The arduino software give you a nice introduction to microprocessors. From there you can move on to AVR-GCC if you so desire. Atmel (who makes the <a title="Atmel AVR" href="http://www.atmel.com/products/avr/default.asp?family_id=607&amp;source=products_home">AVR series</a>) has a wide range of microprocessors with different peripherals.  So if you have any interest in computers, electronics, or programming, check out the Arduino.</p>
