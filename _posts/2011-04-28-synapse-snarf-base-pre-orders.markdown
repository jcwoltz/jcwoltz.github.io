<p>Please see the following post to see about the SNARF-BASE:</p>
<p><a title="Synapse: Users of RFEs, Why Re-invent the wheel?" href="https://www.jcwoltz.com/2011/03/synapse-users-of-rfes-why-re-invent-the-wheel/">https://www.jcwoltz.com/2011/03/synapse-users-of-rfes-why-re-invent-the-wheel/</a></p>
<p>The PCBs for the SNARF-BASE v3i5 will be coming in next week. In order  to know many parts to order, I am asking for commitments. No money  needed at this time.<br />
If I get commitments for 60 boards(total as a group), the price for you will be $37.00/board + shipping<br />
If I get commitments for 25 boards(total as a group), the price for you will be $41.00/board + shipping</p>
<p>I  do not have the money to simply order the parts for all the boards and  have them sitting around. For people interested after the Pre-orders are  done, the price will be $50.00, unless their order is 25+ boards.</p>
<p>If interested, please email me with how many boards you want, and your mailing address.<br />
I  would like to close Pre-orders on May 6th, and order the parts. (if  needed, pre-orders can be extended, but delivery time will be delayed  too)<br />
The timeline for board assembly and mailing<br />
Payments to be made in full prior to your shipping<br />
Boards should be ready to be mailed out May 17th</p>
<h2>Update May 1, 2011:</h2>
<p>Below are image exports from the design software. The SNARF-BASE is the first two images. The ATMega32u4 is the next two images. A Basic protoboard that fits as an addon to the base board is the next image. Then the last image is the Breakout Board. The breakout board is intended to be a cheap simple way to get access to all radio pins or a small node that doesn't need much.</p>
