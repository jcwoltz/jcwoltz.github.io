<p><a title="Amani GT" href="http://majolsurf.net/wordpress/?page_id=1663">Amani GT</a> is a CPLD Shield for arduino form factor fast photo-typing. If you use an Arduino (or other similar board) and have never used a CPLD before, the Amani GT is a great starting point. The simplest way to use a CPLD is draw a schematic with standard logic from the 740 series. From there you can move on to using Verilog HDL. The Author/Creator of the Amani provides examples and various projects.</p>
